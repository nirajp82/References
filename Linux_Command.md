* `scp -r -i "/Users/John.Doe/Documents/auth.pem" ec2user@12.34.56.789:my_dir ~/Downloads/` : This scp command is copying the contents of the "my_dir" directory on the remote server (via SSH using the private key auth.pem) to your local system's "~/Downloads/" directory, and it does so recursively, preserving the directory structure.
* `sudo chmod -R 755 my_dir/`: This command is used to modify the permissions of a directory and its contents recursively. This will give the owner of my_dir full control (read, write, execute), allowing the group and others to read and execute files within my_dir, and not allowing anyone to write to the files or directories inside my_dir.
  * 755: These are the permission settings being applied. In Unix-like systems, permissions are represented using three digits (0-7) for each of the three permission categories: owner, group, and others. Here's what each digit represents in the 755 permission setting:
    * The first digit (7) represents the owner's permissions, which are set to read (4), write (2), and execute (1). In this case, the owner has full read, write, and execute permissions on my_dir.
    * The second digit (5) represents the group's permissions, which are set to read (4) and execute (1). The group has read and execute permissions but no write permission.
    * The third digit (5) represents the permissions for others (everyone else). Like the group, they have read and execute permissions but no write permission.
